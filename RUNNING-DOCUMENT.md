# Running Document

> Read this document at the start of every Cowork session.

This is your continuity artifact. It tells Claude what has been decided, what rules apply, and what must not be forgotten.

---

## How To Use

1. Point Claude to this file at the start of every session
2. Update it at the end of sessions when decisions change
3. Never let Claude reconstruct what's in here — this is the source of truth

**Prompt to start sessions:**

> "Read RUNNING-DOCUMENT.md before we begin. This contains our current state, active rules, and constraints. Confirm you've loaded it."
